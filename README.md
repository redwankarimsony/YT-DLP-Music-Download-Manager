# YT-DLP-Music-Download-Manager
This is a wrapper around YT-DLP to download all the music files in mp3 format.

## How to Use It
You don't need to install it in your machine.  
Clone the repo in your machine and enter into it via command line and run the download script.

All you need is to have `python` installed in your machine and `ffmpeg` for converting the default youtube format `webm` to `mp3` format.


If your system does not have `ffmpeg`, please install that via following command. 
```
sudo apt install ffmpeg
```
